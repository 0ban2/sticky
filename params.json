{"name":"Sticky","body":"# Sticky\r\n\r\nSticky is a jQuery plugin that gives you the ability to make any element on your page always stay visible.\r\n\r\n## Sticky in brief\r\n\r\nThis is how it works:\r\n\r\n- When the target element is about to be hidden, the plugin will add the class `className` to it (and to a wrapper added as its parent), set it to `position: fixed` and calculate its new `top`, based on the element's height, the page height and the `topSpacing` and `bottomSpacing` options.\r\n- That's it. In some cases you might need to set a fixed width to your element when it is \"sticked\". Check the `example-*.html` files for some examples.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n- Include jQuery & Sticky.\r\n- Call Sticky.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"jquery.sticky.js\"></script>\r\n<script>\r\n  $(document).ready(function(){\r\n    $(\"#sticker\").sticky({topSpacing:0});\r\n  });\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Edit your css to position the elements (check the examples in `example-*.html`).\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n- `topSpacing`: Pixels between the page top and the element's top.\r\n- `bottomSpacing`: Pixels between the page bottom and the element's bottom.\r\n- `className`: CSS class added to the element and its wrapper when \"sticked\".\r\n- `wrapperClassName`: CSS class added to the wrapper.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n- `sticky(options)`: Initializer. `options` is optional.\r\n- `sticky('update')`: Recalculates the element's position.\r\n ","tagline":"jQuery Plugin for Sticky Objects","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
